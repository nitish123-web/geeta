                between February and November 1926 at the Satyagraha Ashram in Ahmedabad, India. During this time‚Äîa
                period when Gandhi had withdrawn from mass political activity‚Äîhe devoted much of his time and energy to
                translating the Gita from Sanskrit into his native Gujarati. As a result, he met with his followers
                almost daily, after morning prayer sessions, to discuss the Gita‚Äôs contents and meaning as it unfolded
                before him. This book is the transcription of those daily sessions.

                across quotes on the Gita by several eminent global thinkers. As I was born and brought up in India,
                where the Gita was spoken millennia ago, I was familiar with it as an ancient Hindu text. I had even
                memorized a few of its verses for recitation contests in school. But I had very little idea that its
                wisdom might be relevant in modern times, let alone that eminent Western thinkers had admired it. No
                wonder the list of Gita admirers that seemed to be like an intellectual who‚Äôs who in recent world
                history left me pleasantly shocked.</p>

                Prabhupada (Srila Prabhupada) since 1974. He first met Bhaktivedanta Swami in Dallas, USA.[6] Alfred
                Ford joined the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (the Hare Krishnas) in 1975, and that
                same year he made his first trip to India with Prabhupada. He assisted in the establishment of the first
                Hindu temple in Hawaii and also donated $500,000 to help establish the Bhaktivedanta Cultural Centre in
                Detroit[7] which was completed in 1983.[3] Alfred Ford has made many significant donations to ISKCON
                over the years, which have assisted ongoing projects to build the Pushpa Samadhi Mandir of Prabhupada.
                He is the chairman of the Sri Mayapur Temple of the Vedic Planetarium (also called TOVP).[8]

                Ford is said to have supported the construction of a Vedic cultural centre in Moscow at an estimated
                cost of $10 million.[9] He also bought a $600,000 mansion to house a Hare Krishna temple and learning
                centre in Honolulu.[3] </p>
